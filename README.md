## 🐛 User Feedback & Bug Fixes (Level 5)

The following issues were collected from user feedback and resolved in commit [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef).

| # | Feedback | Type | Fix | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Double popup appears when confirming a transaction | Visual / UI glitch | Added a `_signingInProgress` mutex in `signAndSend` to prevent concurrent Freighter sign requests from stacking | [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef) |
| 2 | Clicking `/subscribe` with wallet connected still required re-connecting to view subscriptions | Critical bug | Fixed `useDashboard` being called with the read-only fallback address instead of the real wallet address; subscription status checks now use the connected wallet | [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef) |
| 3 | No way for subscribers to know their subscription is about to expire | Missing feature | Added expiry date display and ⚠ warning banners (≤3 days) with a one-click **Renew** button in the My Subscriptions section | [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef) |
| 4 | Performance degradation — slowness / freezing when loading tiers | Performance | Parallelised all tier fetches with `Promise.all` (was sequential `for` loop); same fix applied to subscription status checks on `/subscribe` | [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef) |
| 5 | "Recent Subscriptions" section showed hardcoded fake placeholder data | Visual / UI glitch | Replaced fake rows with real on-chain tier data; section renamed to "Subscription Tiers Overview" | [`5694fef`](https://github.com/gaurav190901/stellarvault/commit/5694fef) |



## What is StellarVault?

StellarVault is a production-ready, fully on-chain subscription protocol built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform. It lets creators, DAOs, and SaaS products monetize with transparent, trustless subscriptions — no middlemen, no platform cuts, no custody risk.

Every subscription is a smart contract interaction. Every payment is a blockchain transaction. Every revenue split is enforced by code — not by a company's terms of service.

```

                              on every payment

## 🏗 Architecture

StellarVault is composed of **3 auditable Soroban smart contracts**:

### `SubscriptionManager` — Core Contract
The main orchestrator. Handles tier creation, subscribe/renew/cancel flows, and TTL-aware persistent subscription records on-chain.

```rust
pub fn subscribe(env: Env, subscriber: Address, tier_id: u32) {
    subscriber.require_auth();
    // Direct transfer: subscriber pays admin (no intermediate balance needed)
    token::Client::new(&env, &payment_token)
        .transfer(&subscriber, &admin, &tier.price);
    // Mint VAULT reward tokens to subscriber
    VaultTokenClient::new(&env, &vault_token)
        .mint(&subscriber, &reward_amount);
    // Store subscription record with TTL extension
    env.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, duration, duration * 2);
}
```

### `RevenueRouter` — Payment Splits
Distributes incoming payments to multiple recipients using configurable basis points. All splits must sum to exactly 10,000 bps (100%).

### `VaultToken` — SEP-41 Fungible Token
Fully compliant Stellar fungible token. Mints VAULT rewards to subscribers on every payment. Only the SubscriptionManager can call `mint()`.
